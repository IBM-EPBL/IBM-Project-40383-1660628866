## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Water is considered as a vital resource that affects various aspects of human health and lives. The quality of water is a major concern for people living in urban areas. The quality of water serves as a powerful environmental determinant and a foundation for the prevention and control of waterborne diseases. However, predicting the urban water quality is a challenging task since the water quality varies in urban spaces non-linearly and depends on multiple factors, such as meteorology, water usage patterns, and land uses, so this project aims at building a Machine Learning (ML) model to Predict Water Quality by considering all water quality standard indicators.
